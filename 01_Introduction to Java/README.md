## 1. Introduction to Java

Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language developed by *James Gosling* at *Sun Microsystems* in 1995. It is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible, making it ideal for developing platform-independent applications.

### 🔹 What is Java?

Java is a general-purpose programming language known for its *Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA)* capability. Java code is compiled into bytecode which runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), enabling it to run on any platform that supports Java without needing to recompile.

### 🔹 History of Java

* *1991*: Initiated as the Green Project by James Gosling and his team.
* *1995*: Officially released as Java 1.0 by Sun Microsystems.
* *2009*: Oracle Corporation acquired Sun Microsystems, becoming the owner of Java.

### 🔹 Features of Java

* *Platform Independent*: Java bytecode runs on any device with a JVM.
* *Object-Oriented*: Everything is treated as an object.
* *Simple*: Easy to learn with a syntax similar to C++.
* *Secure*: Provides a secure execution environment.
* *Robust*: Strong memory management and exception handling.
* *Multithreaded*: Supports concurrent execution of two or more threads.
* *High Performance*: Bytecode execution via JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler.
* *Distributed*: Can be used to create distributed applications using RMI and EJB.

### 🔹 Java Editions

1. *Java SE (Standard Edition)*: For general-purpose programming.
2. *Java EE (Enterprise Edition)*: For large-scale, distributed, and web-based applications.
3. *Java ME (Micro Edition)*: For mobile devices and embedded systems.
4. *JavaFX*: For building rich internet applications with modern UI.
